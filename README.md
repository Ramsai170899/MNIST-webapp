# MNIST Digit Recognition with Deep Learning

This project is a simple web application that uses deep learning to recognize hand-drawn digits. It's based on the MNIST dataset, a popular dataset for digit recognition. you can find the kaggle notebook link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ramsaijagadish/mnist-digit-recognition/edit) for the Deep Learning part of the project. the web app is also integrated with the colab and flask 's integration using ngrok which can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18RD_QpPxHa4wnBPZ1Tw9bnrHzbufWe5I#scrollTo=zF3hNKiKWPeb)

## Features

- Allows users to draw a digit on a canvas.
- Predicts the drawn digit using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- Displays the predicted digit on the screen.
- Provides an option to clear the canvas and make a new prediction.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A Python web framework used for serving the web application.
- TensorFlow and Keras: Deep learning libraries for building and training the digit recognition model.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for the front end to create the drawing canvas and handle user interactions.
