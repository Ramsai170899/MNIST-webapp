## Features

- Allows users to draw a digit on a canvas.
- Predicts the drawn digit using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- Displays the predicted digit on the screen.
- Provides an option to clear the canvas and make a new prediction.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A Python web framework used for serving the web application.
- TensorFlow and Keras: Deep learning libraries for building and training the digit recognition model.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for the frontend to create the drawing canvas and handle user interactions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-digit-recognition.git
